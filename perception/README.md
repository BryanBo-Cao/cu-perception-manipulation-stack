## TODO:

- [X] Publish a custom message with identified objects that includes pose, grasping points, object type, maybe a unique ID, etc...
- [ ] Identify an object and publish above information
- [ ] Identify multiple objects and publish them
- [ ] Find grasping points on objects ( just hard code initially and for the competition)
- [ ] Use a more general approach for identifying objects (RANSAC or cylindrical fitting) 
- [ ] Combine PCL data with feature matching to identify objects in a basket and publish above information messages
